The Squid Game project is a new crypto project inspired by the Korean hit series on Netflix about a deadly tournament of children's games. SQD is aimed at promoting equality and prosperity which continues to be neglected due to neoliberal capitalism and its brutal realities. Together, we can fight capitalism, which is inherently exploitative, alienating, unstable, unsustainable, and creates massive economic inequality, commodifies people, and is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of human rights while it incentivizes imperialist expansion and war.
