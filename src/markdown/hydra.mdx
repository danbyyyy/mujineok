HydraCap is a community that was originally founded to help people acquire their level of well-being. Nowadays, the social inequalities do frustrate more and more, and the Governments do nothing in order to help peopleâ€™s needs. That said, one of the main narratives of digital currencies, including ours, is that they are decentralized. Hydra Tokens will assure that everyone has a part of our project and that every thought will be heard. People will live in justice and freedom only when everyone agrees with each other, by showing that wealth is only a word, and not a sum of fiat money.
